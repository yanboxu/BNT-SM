BNT-SM
======

Bayes Net Toolbox for Student Modeling (BNT-SM) is an effort to facilitate the use of dynamic Bayes nets in the student modeling community.

BNT-SM inputs a data set and a compact XML specification of a Bayes net model hypothesized by a researcher to describe causal relationships among student knowledge and observed behavior. BNT-SM generates and executes the code to train and test the model using the Bayes Net Toolbox. BNT-SM allows researchers to easily explore different hypothesis with respect to the knowledge representation in a student model. For example, by varying the graphical structure of a Bayesian network, we examined how tutoring intervention can affect students' knowledge state - whether the intervention is likely to scaffold or to help students to learn.

INSTALL
======

BNT-SM is implemented in Matlab, so you need to have Matlab installed and running.
